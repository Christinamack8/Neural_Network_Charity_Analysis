# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis

## Overview of Analysis

Purpose: to use deep-learning neural networks with the TensorFlow platform in Python, to analyze and classify the success of charitable donations.




## Results

Some of the steps I took to try and make the model more accurate were adding hidden layers, changing the activation type, changing the number of epochs and changing the number of neurons in each layer.




## Summary

I did not reach the optimized prediction of accuracy.
